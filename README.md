# THIS REPOSITORY IS FOR PYTHON PROGRAMMING PROJECT

# Student Lifestyle Dataset Analysis
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Student Lifestyle Dataset**, which was downloaded from Kaggle:  
[Student Lifestyle Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/student-lifestyle-dataset)


## Project Overview
This project involves performing an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the "Student Lifestyle Dataset," which includes various attributes related to students' study hours, lifestyle habits, and academic performance. The goal is to analyze and visualize the data to uncover patterns and relationships between the different features, as well as gain insights into the lifestyle choices of students.

## Steps for the Analysis

### 1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
The first step was to load the dataset and perform basic checks:
- Displayed the first few rows to understand the dataset structure.
- Checked the data types of each column and the presence of missing values.
- Generated summary statistics for numerical columns.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
In this step, the dataset was explored to uncover key insights:
- **Distribution of Numerical Columns**: We used histograms to visualize the distribution of continuous variables.
- **Boxplot**: Outliers in the dataset were identified using boxplots.
- **Bar chart**: Relationships between key variables like "study hours" and "GPA" were visualized.

### 3. **Categorical Data Visualization**
Bar plots were used to visualize the distribution of categorical variables, such as "gender" or "lifestyle."

### 4. **Key Insights and Findings**
After analyzing the data, we gathered insights on:
- The most important variables influencing student performance.
- The distribution of study hours and lifestyle habits among students.
- How various factors correlate with academic scores.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into student lifestyle habits and their impact on academic performance. Further analysis could explore predictive modeling to predict student performance based on lifestyle factors.
